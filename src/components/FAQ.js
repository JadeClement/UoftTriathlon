        <h3>Q: How do I join?</h3>
        <p>
          Click here: <a href="/join-us">Joining the club</a>
        </p>

        <h3>Q: What experience do I need?</h3>
        <p>
          A: None really! Joining the club is a great place to start if you want to compete in your first triathlon. Our more experienced members are a great resource if you want to learn more about how to prepare for your first race. We also have a lot of former swimmers and runners who find the club is a great place to transition to the sport of triathlon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please note: You must be able to swim 300m continuously front crawl to attend the swim workouts.
        </p>

        <h3>Q: How old do you have to be to join the Club?</h3>
        <p>
          A: The Club is open to those 18 years and older. Exceptions are made to current University of Toronto students younger than 18.
        </p>

        <h3>Q: What’s a good workout to attend first?</h3>
        <p>
          A: Those interested in trying out the club are welcome to attend one of our Tuesday night coached runs before registering. You’ll get to meet our run coach and members and ask some of the more experienced athletes any questions you may have.
        </p>

        <h3>Q: Do I have to attend all workouts?</h3>
        <p>
          A: No, all workouts are optional. Many of our members train with the club and on their own. For example, some members attend the swim and run workouts but do their bike workouts on a comptutrainer at home.
        </p>

        <h3>Q: Do I have to be a student to join?</h3>
        <p>
          A: No, you just need to be a member of the University of Toronto Athletic Centre. AC membership is open to students, faculty, alumni and members of the community. Many of our members are Grad students, Alumni or working professionals.
        </p>

        <h3>Q: How do I reserve a spot in the spin class?</h3>
        <p>
          A: Spots are reserved on the forum. You can request access to the forum on our website. Once you’ve requested access, we will confirm that you are a member and you will receive an email with your login details.
        </p>

        <h3>Q: Do you offer swim practices longer than 1 hour?</h3>
        <p>
          A: Our swim practices are 2 hours long again!
        </p>

        <h3>Q: What equipment do I need?</h3>
        <p>
          A: The only real equipment you need is a good pair of running shoes and goggles for swim workouts. If you want to attend the outdoor bike workouts, you will need your own bike. We also recommend members get some training tools for swimming such as a pull buoy, paddles, or fins.
        </p>

        <h3>Q: Do I have to race?</h3>
        <p>
          A: No. While we encourage members to race, it is not required. The sport of triathlon is a great way to get in shape or exercise with a group in a fun atmosphere. Students can also compete in the University Multisport Series and travel to events organized by other Ontario University clubs.
        </p>

        <h3>Q: When do sessions start and end? Can I join in the middle of a session?</h3>
        <p>
          A: We operate 12 months a year and offer 3 sessions. Fall (Sept-Dec), Winter (Jan-Apr), Spring (May – Jun), and Summer (Jul – Aug). You may join while the session is in progress. It is the AC’s policy to not pro-rate fees.
        </p>

        <h3>Q: How many workouts do members generally attend in a week?</h3>
        <p>
          A: On average, members attend 2-3 workouts per week. But for optimal performance you may need to do additional non-official workouts which you may want to schedule with other members that you meet.
        </p>

        <h3>Q: If I just want to swim and bike, can I select the Duathlon Package?</h3>
        <p>
          A: The Duathlon Package is for biking/spinning and running only. The reason that we offer this at a reduced fee is because the majority of our coaching costs go towards swim coaching.
