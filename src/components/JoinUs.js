            <h3>The University of Toronto Triathlon Club Charter</h3>
            
            <h4>Introduction</h4>
            <p>The University of Toronto Triathlon Club ("UofT Tri Club") is a triathlon club which is open to all individuals which are members of the Athletic Center - please note you have to be 18 years old, unless you are a 17 year old student (see the Athletic Centers guidelines for more information).</p>
            
            <p>The UofT Tri Club is run by an executive team, which consists of different members who volunteer their time. While the executive team will change, they are best reached by email at <a href="mailto:info@uofttriathlon.com">info@uofttriathlon.com</a>, additionally you can reach out through social media. Please give them time to answer.</p>
            
            <p>The Executive Team consists of the following positions: President, Treasurer, Secretary, Webmaster, Social coordinator and Social Media Manager; positions can be filled by one or more individuals.</p>
            
            <p>Positions and titles can be updated to meet current needs. Some workouts have coaches, more details under sections 4-6, their contact details are on the UofT Tri Club website. This Charter is a living document, changes can be made when deemed appropriate.</p>

            <h4>Requirements</h4>
            <p>We are open to all beginners, however for safety and cohesion in the pool we do require members who have joined for the full triathlon option to be able to swim 300 meter continuous (turns should not take more than 3 seconds) Front Crawl in under 10 minutes and 30 seconds.</p>

            <h4>General Conduct</h4>
            <p>At all times members must act with integrity, honesty, fairness, and respect in accordance with the University of Toronto Faculty of Kinesiology & Physical Education Student & Member Code of Conduct, the Code of Student Conduct (if the member is also an enrolled student), and the Policy for Safety in Athletic Facilities.</p>
            
            <p>While triathlon is not a contact sport, we understand that inadvertent contact sometimes occurs, try your best to be aware of your surroundings and communicate with others.</p>

            <h4>Swim Specific Conduct</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Respect and listen to the pool staff, they are there not only for the training but also to ensure our safety while we swim.</li>
              <li>Lanes are populated by members on the basis of swim skill, speed, and fitness level - typically increasing in intensity with every subsequent lane. If you are unsure about placement please ask the coach so that they may assist in finding an appropriate lane.</li>
              <li>Members are expected to be able to circle swim within their lanes, unless it is safe to swim side by side.</li>
              <li>When circle swimming, members need to push off the walls at safe distances, usually 10 to 5 seconds unless otherwise specified by the coaches.</li>
              <li>Be on time for the swim workouts, this allows people to start the workout together, avoiding individuals swimming different parts of the workout in the same lane.</li>
              <li>The coaches will track your punctuality, if you are consistently late, late being defined as more than 10 minutes, you can face a suspension of not being allowed to swim (exceptions are described in section Cii).</li>
              <li>We understand that life can get in the way, and that the swim times might not work in your favor, if you know you will consistently come X minutes late (for whatever reason) then let the coaches know, additionally it is likely you will swim with similar people so let them know as well.</li>
              <li>If you are late, first let a coach know you are here, then go to your usual lane and WAIT until all swimmers are stopped or there is a break in the set, let the other swimmers know what you will be doing and then seed yourself accordingly; disregarding this can lead to collisions which poses a safety risk.</li>
              <li>Follow the workouts: the workouts are specifically written for the given training session, if you can't do parts of the workouts or want to modify sections let the coaches and other lane members know.</li>
              <li>If at any point the coaches feel you do not meet the requirement or are a safety issue, it is up to their discretion to ask you not to come to training, with the backing of the UofT Tri Club executive team, if relevant a refund can be given.</li>
              <li>The coaches appreciate feedback but ensure this is done in a respectful and constructive manner.</li>
              <li>Members can leave once they are done, or if they hit a time constraint.</li>
              <li>Make sure to pick up all your items and if you are the last individual leaving your lane, make sure that all printed paper workouts are cleared to avoid clogged gutters.</li>
              <li>If relevant and able we ask that members help with putting in or taking out lane ropes that way it can be done more efficiently, if you are unsure what to do, ask the pool staff for guidance.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Bike Specific Conduct</h4>
            <h5>Indoor Spins:</h5>
            <ul>

              <li>Be on time: after 10 minutes your bike is "given away" if another member is on the waitlist they can then take your spot; coming more than 10 minutes late is viewed as a No Show.</li>

              <li>If you use a tri bike instead of a road bike, please be conscientious of how this will impact your ability to break/shift and do not ride too close to other riders.</li>
              <li>Sign up: you still need to sign up that way the bike leads know to look out for you, where you should meet will be specified on the forum.</li>
