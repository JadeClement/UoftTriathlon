He joined the club in January of 2015. The rationale was to become a good swimmer from near scratch and have a club to train for running races. That summer he raced a duathlon at Welland and thought it was bizarre that in this sport that finishing nowhere near the lead he could still earn a second place podium spot (45-49 age groupers).\nBut what inspired him was that he thought he was running with Olympians because he saw himself racing competitors wearing Team Canada triathlon uniforms. He was mistaken. He found out they were not Olympians, but age-groupers, some like him in the 50s. But he was inspired to earn the privilege to wear those Team Canada trisuit uniforms thinking that might be an achievable goal. He had a bike accident that summer and had to leave the first triathlon till 2016.\nHe finally did his first triathlon, a sprint in Woodstock in 2016. It was a preparation race for the goal of earning a ITU World Championship age-group qualification in the Ottawa National Championship race.\nHis favourite achievement is the New York City Half Marathon 2016, just missing a money spot by one. His duathlon qualification at Esprit de Montreal 2019 for the 2020 ITU Multisport Championships in his mind is his to be executed multisport race.\nAlso he says quite memorable was his Boston qualifying finish at the Toronto Waterfront marathon which he felt was a more important achievement than running Boston itself.\n(Over the COVID hiatus he worked on his swim technique whenever there was a pool opening and thinks he is on the road to fast swims.)\nHis message to young rookie tri-club athletes — “You are likely in the easiest age group to qualify for the World Age-Group Championships, train to qualify, Bragging right last a lifetime here.!”`\n  },\n  'secretary': {\n    name: 'Lauren Williams',\n    role: 'Secretary',\n    image: '/images/team-photo3.jpeg',\n    bio: `Lauren Williams is our club Secretary, responsible for maintaining clear communication and record-keeping within the club.

He joined the club in January of 2015. The rationale was to become a good swimmer from near scratch and have a club to train for running races. That summer he raced a duathlon at Welland and thought it was bizarre that in this sport that finishing nowhere near the lead he could still earn a second place podium spot (45-49 age groupers).\nBut what inspired him was that he thought he was running with Olympians because he saw himself racing competitors wearing Team Canada triathlon uniforms. He was mistaken. He found out they were not Olympians, but age-groupers, some like him in the 50s. But he was inspired to earn the privilege to wear those Team Canada trisuit uniforms thinking that might be an achievable goal. He had a bike accident that summer and had to leave the first triathlon till 2016.\nHe finally did his first triathlon, a sprint in Woodstock in 2016. It was a preparation race for the goal of earning a ITU World Championship age-group qualification in the Ottawa National Championship race.\nHis favourite achievement is the New York City Half Marathon 2016, just missing a money spot by one. His duathlon qualification at Esprit de Montreal 2019 for the 2020 ITU Multisport Championships in his mind is his to be executed multisport race.\nAlso he says quite memorable was his Boston qualifying finish at the Toronto Waterfront marathon which he felt was a more important achievement than running Boston itself.\n(Over the COVID hiatus he worked on his swim technique whenever there was a pool opening and thinks he is on the road to fast swims.)\nHis message to young rookie tri-club athletes — “You are likely in the easiest age group to qualify for the World Age-Group Championships, train to qualify, Bragging right last a lifetime here.!”`\n    },\n    'secretary': {\n      name: 'Lauren Williams',\n      role: 'Secretary',\n      image: '/images/team-photo3.jpeg',\n      bio: `Lauren Williams is our club Secretary, responsible for maintaining clear communication and record-keeping within the club.
